Game name: Snowden Escape. 

Instructions: 
------------
In this game you play as Edward Snowden and learn about his story as you complete
objectives. For the first playable we have implented some of the primary features 
which we will expand on for the final playable.

The user is first presented with a menu which he or she must use in order to
begin playing. For the sake of development (since it is not our final playable),
this menu contains a shortcut to the terminal. This is only so that we do not
have to navigate to the terminal while testing, so please ignore this for now.

In the first level, you will read a short excerpt on Edward Snowden's current
job position and then hit enter. Explore the room and attempt to find documents 
in the room. Use the controls "WASD" to move around the room. Press "F" 
to collect a document. When you collect a document, you should see document
counter in the top left corner increment. In the final playable, the documents 
will serve as an item you must collect in order to advance to the next level.

You must also navigate to a PC in the room beside which you will hit "F" to enter
the terminal. Once inside the terminal you will navigate to a minigame. You must
complete this minigame successfully in order to move to the next level.

To win and go to next level, you must successfully encrypt data. If you are not
able to do this, you cannot go to the next level.

In the final playable we will be increasing the number of levels, improving map 
design, inserting enemies, and increasing overall difficulty of the game. We will
also require that a certain amount of documents have been collected before you can
encrypt and send data to journalists outside of Snowden's current workplace.
